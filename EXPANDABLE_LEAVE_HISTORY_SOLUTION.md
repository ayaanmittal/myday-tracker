# Expandable Leave History - Solution

## 🎯 **Problem Solved**

The user wanted leave history to show:
- **Consecutive leave days grouped together** as one row
- **Separate leave periods** (with gaps) as different rows  
- **Expandable details** showing daily breakdown when clicked
- **Clear indication** of which days were holidays/Sundays with no deduction

## 🎯 **Solution Implemented**

### **1. Smart Leave Grouping Logic**
- **Groups consecutive days** (within 1 day gap) into single periods
- **Separates different leave periods** when there's a gap of more than 1 day
- **Handles mixed leave types** within the same period (e.g., some days unpaid, some office holidays)

### **2. Flexible Period Representation**
- **Primary leave type**: Uses the most common leave type in the period
- **Mixed status handling**: Shows "Mixed" badge when period contains different types
- **Smart deduction logic**: Only shows "Unpaid" if there are actual unpaid days

### **3. Expandable Daily Breakdown**
- **Click to expand**: Each period row is clickable
- **Daily details**: Shows each day with its specific deduction status
- **Clear reasons**: Shows why each day had/didn't have deductions
- **Visual indicators**: Different icons for different day types

## 🎯 **Key Features**

### **Period Grouping Examples:**
```
✅ Oct 15-19 (5 days) → Single period (consecutive)
✅ Oct 22-25 (4 days) → Single period (consecutive) 
✅ Oct 15-19, Oct 22-25 → Two separate periods (gap between)
```

### **Mixed Period Handling:**
```
Period: Oct 15-19 (Paternity Leave)

```
