# Employee Notes Fix - Test Guide

## Problem Fixed
- **Error**: `null value in column "created_by" of relation "employee_notes" violates not-null constraint`
- **Cause**: The `createNote` method was not setting the `created_by` field when inserting new notes
- **Solution**: Updated `EmployeeNotesService.createNote()` to get the current user ID and set it as `created_by`

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `src/services/employeeNotesService.ts`
- Added `supabase.auth.getUser()` to get current user ID
- Set `created_by: user.id` in the insert operation
- Added proper error handling for user authentication

### 2. Key Code Changes
```typescript
// Before (missing created_by):
.insert({
  employee_id: noteData.employee_id,
  // created_by was missing!
  note_date: noteData.note_date,
  // ... other fields
})

// After (with created_by):
const { data: { user }, error: userError } = await supabase.auth.getUser();
.insert({
  employee_id: noteData.employee_id,
  created_by: user.id, // ✅ Now properly set
  note_date: noteData.note_date,
  // ... other fields
})
```

## Testing the Fix

### 1. Test Note Creation
1. Go to Employees page
2. Click "Notes" button next to any employee
3. Click "Add Note"
4. Fill in the form:
   - Title: "Test Note"
   - Content: "This is a test note"
   - Type: "General"
   - Date: Today's date
5. Click "Save Note"
6. ✅ Should create successfully without the null constraint error

### 2. Verify Database
The note should be created with:
- `created_by` field set to the current user's ID
- All other fields properly populated
- No constraint violations

## Expected Results
- ✅ Notes can be created successfully
- ✅ No more "null value in column created_by" errors
- ✅ Each note is properly attributed to the user who created it
- ✅ All existing functionality (view, edit, delete) continues to work

## Database Schema Reference
The `employee_notes` table has:
- `created_by UUID NOT NULL` - Must be set to a valid user ID
- RLS policies ensure only admins can create/view notes
- Foreign key constraints ensure data integrity
