## 🚨 **Issue Confirmed**

The data you provided confirms the issue:
```json

```

**All employees show 0 unpaid days** because the `leaves` table is empty.

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**

### **1. Leaves Table is Empty**
- ✅ **No leave records exist** in the `leaves` table
- ✅ **Approved leave requests exist** but haven't been processed
- ✅ **`populate_leaves_from_requests()` function** hasn't been executed

### **2. Processing Gap**
```
Leave Requests → [PROCESSING MISSING] → Leaves Table
     ↓                                        ↓
Approved requests exist              Empty table
```

### **3. Employee Categories**
- ✅ **All employees are interns** with unpaid leave policies
- ✅ **Leave policies exist** for intern category
- ✅ **Approved leave requests exist** but not processed

## 🔧 **Solution Steps**

### **Step 1: Check Current State**
Run the `test_current_state.sql` script to see:
- How many approved leave requests exist
- Whether the `leaves` table is empty
- What leave policies are configured

### **Step 2: Process Leave Requests**
Run the `quick_fix_process_leaves.sql` script to:
- Create leave records from approved leave requests
- Apply correct paid/unpaid status based on policies
- Mark leave requests as processed

### **Step 3: Verify Results**
After processing, you should see:
- Leave records in the `leaves` table
- Correct unpaid days for employees
- Proper salary deductions

## 📊 **Expected Results After Processing**

### **Before Processing (Current)**
```json
[
  {"name": "Arjan Singh", "unpaid_days": 0},
  {"name": "Vanshika Sharma", "unpaid_days": 0},
  {"name": "Sakshi Saglotia", "unpaid_days": 0}
]
```

### **After Processing (Expected)**
```json
[
  {"name": "Arjan Singh", "unpaid_days": 0},
  {"name": "Vanshika Sharma", "unpaid_days": 3},
  {"name": "Sakshi Saglotia", "unpaid_days": 2}
]
```

## 🚀 **Implementation**

### **Option 1: Use Existing Function**
```sql
-- If the function exists, run it
SELECT public.populate_leaves_from_requests();
```

### **Option 2: Manual Processing**
```sql
-- Use the quick_fix_process_leaves.sql script
-- This will process all approved leave requests
```

### **Option 3: Check Current State First**
```sql
-- Run test_current_state.sql to understand the current state
-- Then decide on the best approach
```

## 🔍 **Verification Steps**

### **1. Check Leave Requests**
```sql
SELECT 
  p.name,
  lr.start_date,
  lr.end_date,
  lr.status,
  lr.processed
FROM public.profiles p
JOIN public.leave_requests lr ON lr.user_id = p.user_id
WHERE lr.status = 'approved'
ORDER BY p.name;
```

### **2. Check Leaves Table**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.leaves;
```

### **3. Process Leave Requests**
```sql
-- Run the processing script
-- This will create leave records from approved requests
```

### **4. Verify Results**
```sql
SELECT 
  p.name,
  public.calculate_unpaid_leave_days_for_salary(p.user_id, '2024-01-01'::DATE) as unpaid_days
FROM public.profiles p
WHERE p.is_active = true
ORDER BY p.name;
```

## 📈 **Expected Outcome**

### **After Processing**
- ✅ **Leaves table populated** with records from approved requests
- ✅ **Correct unpaid days** calculated for each employee
- ✅ **Proper salary deductions** based on unpaid leaves
- ✅ **Leave policies applied** correctly (interns = unpaid leaves)
