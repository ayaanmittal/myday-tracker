# Leave Deductions Preview - Expected Results

## ðŸŽ¯ **What the Leave Deductions Preview Should Show**

The "Leave Deductions Preview" should now calculate correctly based on:
1. âœ… **Employee work days** (Mon-Sat for all employees)
2. âœ… **Unpaid leave days** (from the leaves table)
3. âœ… **Daily rate calculation** (base_salary Ã· work_days_in_month)
4. âœ… **Deduction calculation** (daily_rate Ã— unpaid_days Ã— deduction_percentage)

## ðŸ“Š **Expected Results for October 2025**

### **Employees with Salaries and Unpaid Leaves**

#### **Dolly Jhamb**
```
Base Salary: â‚¹5,000
Work Days: 27 (Mon-Sat in October 2025)
Daily Rate: â‚¹5,000 Ã· 27 = â‚¹185.19
Unpaid Days: 3
Deduction (100%): â‚¹185.19 Ã— 3 = â‚¹555.57
Net Salary: â‚¹5,000 - â‚¹555.57 = â‚¹4,444.43
```

#### **Isha Sharma**
```
Base Salary: â‚¹5,000
Work Days: 27 (Mon-Sat in October 2025)
Daily Rate: â‚¹5,000 Ã· 27 = â‚¹185.19
Unpaid Days: 3
Deduction (100%): â‚¹185.19 Ã— 3 = â‚¹555.57
Net Salary: â‚¹5,000 - â‚¹555.57 = â‚¹4,444.43
```

#### **Sakshi Saglotia**
```
Base Salary: â‚¹10,000
Work Days: 27 (Mon-Sat in October 2025)
Daily Rate: â‚¹10,000 Ã· 27 = â‚¹370.37
Unpaid Days: 8
Deduction (100%): â‚¹370.37 Ã— 8 = â‚¹2,962.96
Net Salary: â‚¹10,000 - â‚¹2,962.96 = â‚¹7,037.04
```

### **Employees with Salaries but No Unpaid Leaves**

#### **Arjan Singh**
```
Base Salary: â‚¹14,000
Work Days: 27 (Mon-Sat in October 2025)
Daily Rate: â‚¹14,000 Ã· 27 = â‚¹518.52
Unpaid Days: 0
Deduction (100%): â‚¹0.00
Net Salary: â‚¹14,000 - â‚¹0.00 = â‚¹14,000.00
```

### **Employees without Salaries**

#### **Ayaan Mittal, Hiralal, Jaspreet Kaur, Raman Thapa, Test Manager, Vanshika Sharma, Vikas Mittal**
```
Base Salary: null
Work Days: 27 (Mon-Sat in October 2025)
Daily Rate: â‚¹0.00
Unpaid Days: X (varies by employee)
Deduction (100%): â‚¹0.00
Net Salary: â‚¹0.00
```

## ðŸ”§ **How the Calculation Works**

### **1. Work Days Calculation**
```
October 2025 has 31 days
Mon-Sat work days = 27 days
(5 Mondays + 5 Tuesdays + 5 Wednesdays + 5 Thursdays + 5 Fridays + 2 Saturdays)
```

### **2. Daily Rate Calculation**
```
Daily Rate = Base Salary Ã· Work Days in Month
Daily Rate = Base Salary Ã· 27
```

### **3. Unpaid Leave Calculation**
```
Unpaid Days = Count of leave records where is_paid_leave = false
For October 2025, this comes from the leaves table
```

### **4. Deduction Calculation**
```
Deduction = Daily Rate Ã— Unpaid Days Ã— Deduction Percentage
Deduction = Daily Rate Ã— Unpaid Days Ã— (100% or user-defined %)
```

### **5. Net Salary Calculation**
```
Net Salary = Base Salary - Deduction
Net Salary = Base Salary - (Daily Rate Ã— Unpaid Days Ã— Deduction %)
```

## ðŸ“ˆ **Frontend Display Format**

The Leave Deductions Preview should show:
